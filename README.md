2. Supposedly you have done the steps from the [MachineLearning](https://github.com/CH2-PS412/MachineLearning)repository, you can continue these steps. If not, check the [MachineLearning](https://github.com/CH2-PS412/MachineLearning) and repository and finish the steps there first (otherwise you can't complete these steps).
3. Open terminal in the project root directory, then run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies.
4. Run the application on terminal using this command: `python app.py`.
